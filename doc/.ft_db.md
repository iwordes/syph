Bytecode based database system

Notes
 ---
1. Effectively, all statements are like prepared statements:
	- The statement itself is a bytecode string followed by parameters.
	- The statement defines the traits of the expected following parameters.
	- The parameters are constrained as follows:
		i. Integers are of fixed base-2 size.
		ii. Strings and bytestreams are prefaced with a u32 length in bytes.
2. As in SQL, database schemas define a hard upper bound to the size of any given field: e.g. a string may cap at `str[n]` characters.
3. Integral types are specified as `u|i``8|16|32|64`.
4. Decimal types are specified as `f``32|64`.
5. Eventually, BigInt and Decimal (unbound precision) types may be available.


Impl: Preallocate the greater of 8 blocks or the minimum base-2 number of blocks necessary to store 8 entries

Q
-
- 255--256-field limit on schemas? (request fields by bytecode)
