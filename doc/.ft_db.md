Bytecode based database system

Notes
 ---
1. Effectively, all statements are like prepared statements:
	- The statement itself is a bytecode string followed by parameters.
	- The statement defines the traits of the expected following parameters.
	- The parameters are constrained as follows:
		i. Integers are of fixed base-2 size.
		ii. Strings and bytestreams are prefaced with a u32 length in bytes.
2. As in SQL, database schemas define a hard upper bound to the size of any given field: e.g. a string may cap at `str[n]` characters.
3. Integral types are specified as `u|i``8|16|32|64`.
4. Decimal types are specified as `f``32|64`.
5. Eventually, BigInt and Decimal (unbound precision) types may be available.

Requirements
------------

2. [+] Create a table.
    1. Get next offset
    2. Write 4096B header
    3. Allocate N blocks for body
3. [+] Insert into table
    1. Get next offset
    2. Grow db if necessary
    3. Grow table if necessary +
    4. Write data
4. [+] Select from table
    1. Iterate over entries
    2. Compare for each entry
    3. Retrieve desired fields for each match
5. [+] Update table
    1. Iterate over entries
    2. Compare for each entry
    3. Apply assignments for each match
6. [+] Delete from table
    1. Iterate over entries
    2. Compare for each entry
    3. Zero out entry for each match
